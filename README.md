# glob-library-go

Glob style pattern matcher for strings in Go.

## Why

This is a port of my https://github.com/hrakaroo/glob-library-java library
to Go.  All of the code (including tests) have been pulled over and converted. 
Everything compiles and all tests pass. I still want to run some benchmarks 
before calling it "done".

I also acknowledge that this library isn't as _needed_ for Go since Go ships
with it's own https://go.dev/src/path/filepath/match.go and https://pkg.go.dev/v.io/v23/glob 
which looks to operate pretty similar.

## Code Coverage

The [code coverage report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hrakaroo/glob-library-go/blob/master/coverage.html) was generated by running:

```
go test -coverprofile coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

Files
```
100.0% for engine.go
97.6% for compiler.go
```

Overall
```
98.7% of statements
```

The coverage missing in compiler.go is mostly around using the option builders.  I'll add more tests in shortly
to get this to 100%

## Releases

### v0.1.0-alpha

First tagged version of this library. To use it add

`require github.com/hrakaroo/glob-library-go v0.1.0-alpha`

in your `go.mod` file and then import the library with

`import glob "github.com/hrakaroo/glob-library-go"`

in your code.  For my simple test this worked pretty well:

```
func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello")
	m, err := glob.Compile("*foo*")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(m.Matches("bogfoo"))
}
```
